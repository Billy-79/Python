# first we should install the following package

sudo apt install python3-virtualenv

# then

which virtualenv

# will output /usr/bin/virtualenv

# to create the virtual environment

virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 virtual_environments

# enter the directory created from the previous command 

# being in the directory isn't enough we must activate the virtual environment

# with the following command

source bin/activate

# this will activate the virtual environment but also changed our bash prompt

# moreover, if we do " which python " or " which python3 " we will get 

# /home/<username>/<project name>/python or python3 accordingly, which means that the 

# virtual environment use the binaries that have been copied into the folder that was 

# created for the virtual environment

# to deactivate the virtual environment

deactivate

# there are 2 ways to install a package in python we could install the distribution 

# package, which means it will be available through the entire distribution or we can 

# install a package within our virtual environment.

# the best method though is to install a package within our virtual environment, as this 

# will ensure for example that we don't have packages that only used in one or very few 

# projects or even not using them at all but also it helps to avoid security risks.

# so to install a package we use the pip3 command but within our virtual environment

which pip3

# to search for a package

# CAUTION " pip search " no longer supported

# Please use https://pypi.org/search (via a browser) instead.

# to install e.g. " Flask " package

pip install Flask

# this will install additional packages that are required.

# to uninstall a package e.g. " Flask "

pip uninstall Flask

# to see all installed packages

pip list
